Welcome to my humble Minecraft Tools-and-Weapons (TAW) mod!

#Features
The currently implemented features for Mincraft are as follows:
* Glass tools:
  * "Industrial Glass" blocks made from smelting "Hardy Glass Materials"
  * The recipe for "Industrial Glass Materials" (iron ingot surrounded by glass blocks)
* Obsidian tools
* Ender tools (made of Eyes of Ender)

##Planned Features
I am planning on adding the following (in order of priority):

1. Trinium and tools (a fictional element from Stargate that is 100x lighter & stronger than steel: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinium#Trinium)
2. The Ender Pickaxe will be able to harvest monster spawners (no easy way to do this; not coming any time soon)
3. 
   * Possibly emerald tools 
   * Possibly ice tools as an alternative to wood tools

#Installation
To compile this mod from source, you will need a copy of the MCP (Minecraft coder-pack) ready,
version 4.7.*. Inside mcp/src/minecraft, create the path jw/taw/ and copy the downloaded source into it.
You should now be ready to build and run in the IDE of your choice!
