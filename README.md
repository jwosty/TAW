Welcome to my humble Minecraft Tools-and-Weapons (TAW) mod!

#Features
The currently implemented features for Mincraft are as follows:
* Glass tools:
  * "Industrial Glass" blocks made from smelting "Hardy Glass Materials"
  * The recipe for "Industrial Glass Materials" (iron ingot surrounded by glass blocks)
* Obsidian tools

##Planned Features
I am planning on adding the following:
* Ender tools, made from Ender Pearls. The pickaxe will be able to harvest monster spawners
* Possibly emerald tools 
* Possibly ice tools as an alternative to wood tools

#Installation
To compile this mod from source, you will need a copy of the MCP (Minecraft coder-pack) ready,
version 4.7.*. Inside mcp/src/minecraft, create the path jw/taw/ and copy the downloaded source into it.
You should now be ready to build and run in the IDE of your choice!
