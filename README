Welcome to my humble Minecraft Tools-and-Weapons (TAW) mod!

#Features
The currently implemented features for Mincraft are as follows:
* Glass tools:
  * "Hardy Glass" blocks made from smelting "Hardy Glass Materials"
  * The recipe for "Hardy Glass Materials" (iron ingot surrounded by glass blocks)
* Obsidian tools

##Planned Features
I am planning on adding the following:
* Ender tools, made from Ender Pearls. The pickaxe will be able to harvest monster spawners
* Possibly emerald tools 
* Possibly ice tools as an alternative to wood tools
